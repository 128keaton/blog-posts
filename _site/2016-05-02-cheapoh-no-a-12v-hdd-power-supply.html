<p>Welcome back to another segment of ‘Cheap-Oh no!’. Today, we are looking at a power supply that came with a USB-&gt;PATA/IDE/SATA bridge. I burnt out my last one, and I didn’t pay close enough attention to what I’d, unfortunately, purchased. Whoopsie. Honey, I bought a knock-off.</p>

<p>Look at that. ‘Trained Service Personal Only’, I am personally trained in service, yes.</p>

<p>Nothing grabs your attention like HAZARDOUSAREA and ZONEDANGEREUSE.</p>

<p>Oh. Darn. No Servilceable components inside, too bad I am servicing instead.</p>

<p>Lets unscrew the case.</p>

<p>Notice what is missing? Freaking <em>fuses</em>. Have fun with this one, kiddos, it is sure to be a <em>wild</em> ride.</p>

<p>You know what should’ve tipped me off? The fact that the brand on Amazon was ‘Generic’</p>

<p>Don’t buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Adapter-Converter-Optical-External/dp/B002OV1VJW?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00">this</a>.</p>
